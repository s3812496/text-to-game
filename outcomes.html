        <h1>Project Motivation</h1>
        <h3>Describe what motivated your group to choose this particular project? </h3>

        <p id="Anthony">
            The group collectively chose this project due to having a passion for video games. We grew up in an
            environment surrounded by video games and spent most of our childhood sharing laughter and joy with our
            family and friends through video games. Given the chance to come up with our very own project, we thought it
            would be a great idea to develop an idea which would provide other people who love games just like us to
            develop their own text-based game and share their creative imagination with the rest of the world. We felt
            that entry-level game-making was too hard to access for everyday people with no prior experience in
            programming or technology in general and as a result, our group wanted to be that bridge that would allow
            beginners the opportunity to cross the bridge into game development. The platform that we’re hoping to
            create would hopefully give birth to many new innovative games. The group’s collective love for games is
            what motivated us to choose this project and to put smiles on other people’s faces.
        </p>
        <p id="Nicholas">
            We asked around if anyone had any ideas for a new game and nothing came up until Jack William Brown
            mentioned a text- based interactive game which we all agreed was a good idea. None of us really wanted to
            come up with and write a story however so in the end we decided to create a tool that would make it easier
            for authors to make interactive stories. We were particularly interested in this project because we all
            loved the idea of making a game and a text-based game seemed the best fit. We thought that having to write a
            story ourselves would be too difficult for a team project. There would not be enough work to go around and
            writing a worthwhile story takes time. All these reasons motivated us to choose a project where the beginner
            programmers could learn while the more experienced members could be challenged as well as produce a service
            that could be used properly and potentially monetised.
        </p>

        <h3>How does it relate to your individual and collective interests? It is a laudable aim to try and create
            something which is beyond your current knowledge level and which addresses areas where you can enrich your
            IT Skills. </h3>
        <p id="Nicholas">
            The programming in this project was divided specifically into stations. Nicholas Leppan(s3840050) and Nathan
            Martina(S3812496) took on the role of laying out what the program is going to require.
        </p>
        <p id="Anthony">
            Although this is a programming heavy project, some group members such as myself (Anthony), have only a basic
            understanding of programming and as such my skills must be utilized elsewhere to fulfil my duty within the
            group.
        </p>
        <p id="Nicholas">
            We decided that the program would be developed in Java because all members have experience in the language.
            The project has been laid out to contain simple methods like displaying windows, text and buttons. With all
            the complex methods such as storing information and creating the mapping system used for all parent-child
            relations in chapters. The more complex programs will also be the ones that controls the flow of the program
            and the parameters used in each simple feature, this means that the more advanced programmers that will be
            working on the complex mappings will also need to supervise the information that will be go into and be
            returned by all other methods. This forces anyone working on the complex programs to help those working on
            smaller programs and means that every member will have to check in with progress often, so no one is left
            behind.
        </p>
        <p id="Anthony">
            Furthermore, this would be a good learning experience for all group members involved as Nicholas and Nathan
            being the best programmers of the group can share their knowledge of programming to the rest of the members
            and vice-versa to create a well-rounded group who knows their strengths and weaknesses. Individually, this
            project serves to enrich other areas of IT in which we normally aren’t familiar with and helps each group
            member step outside their comfort zone and really delve into the deep end of the pool.
        </p>
        <p id="Nicholas">
            Overall, the main difficulty that will challenge the members is getting each feature to work together in one
            program. Also, this project is very much not suited to brute force solutions and requires more elegant ways
            to create the program. This is not easy for new programmers with little experience and will likely cause
            problems for all members later in the project.
        </p>
        <p id="Anthony">
            Collectively, it would be in the group’s best interest to recruit members with many different strengths in
            order to evenly distribute the workload and allow those who are more sufficient at java work on the
            programming aspect of the project and those who specialise in design/admin take on that aspect of the
            project.

        <h5>Description of test:</h5>
        <p id="Nicholas">
            This will be test on whether from our program, can we create a separate executable file that holds the
            completed story.
            Can the separate file run?
            Does it require the original program?
            What format is it in?
            Does this work more than once?
        </p>

        <h3>6 - Choosing next option</h3>
        <h5>Description of feature:</h5>
        <p id="Nicholas">
            We will be using a numeral system where each option will be put into a list and the user can create the
            label of the option i.e. 1. run 2. jump 3. hide
        </p>
        <h5>Description of test:</h5>
        <p id="Nicholas">
            Does each option show on the parent chapter?
            How long or short can the options read
            How many options can it have?
            This is tested by creating a series of chapters and options and running the full program therefore it will
            be one of the final tests

        </p>
        <h5>Description of test:</h5>
        <p id="Nicholas">
            We will test whether the chapter automatically saves into our database.

        </p>
        <h5>Description of test:</h5>
        <p id="Nicholas">
            The test for this involves created various empty or dummy stories and testing the displayed information is
