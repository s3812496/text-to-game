        <h2>Resources and Tools</h2>
        <h5>Eclipse IDE</h5>
        <ul id="Nathan">
            <li>Eclipse is an opensource code editing software that can edit java files.</li>
            <li>We are using eclipse because it is open source so does not incur a cost to use for this project as
                compared to paid options such as visual studio code</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/ide/">https://www.eclipse.org/ide/</a></li>
            <li>An alternative we could have used although it has a cost is Microsoft Visual Studio Code with a Java
                plugin <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h5>SQL Lite</h5>
        <ul id="Nathan">
            <li><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">https://www.sqlite.org/index.html</a></li>
            <li>SQL Lite is a free editor for SQL databases and can produce as well as create queries for the database
            </li>
            <li>We chose to use SQL Lite because of the previous experience in the group, most people have used SQL Lite
                prior as this means we don’t have to learn how to use a new database program for the coding of this
                project</li>
            <li>We are going to be using SQL Lite version 3.33.0 as this is the most current version and incurs no cost
                to use</li>
            <li>An alternative would include MongoDB <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">https://www.mongodb.com/</a>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Java SDK</h5>
        <ul id="Nathan">
            <li><a
                    href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html">https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html</a>
            </li>
            <li>Java JDK is the source code for Java that is required to run the Java code that we compile in Eclipse
                IDE without the JDK we will not be able to write or run the program</li>
            <li>Java JDK is provided by Oracle and incurs no cost to use for writing the program or for the end users to
                install to run the program</li>
            <li>We will be using JDK Version 14.0.2 for our program</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>GitHub desktop or Kraken</h5>
        <ul id="Nathan">
            <li>GitHub desktop and Kraken are programs that facilitate pushing and pulling changes from the repo that we
                will be using to store our code during the project</li>
            <li>Each team member can use their choosing of program for this purpose however theses 2 are the most common
                used, they will also be used to settle git clashes easier as they have a UI for clash resolving.</li>
            <li>GitHub desktop is provided free and Kraken is free with an educational license of GitHub witch all the
                group members should have as they are enrolled at RMIT</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Collaborative Workspaces</h2>
    <h5>Teams</h5>
    <ul id="Nathan">
        <li><a
                href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software">https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software</a>
        </li>
        <li>Our teams page is located on the subject team group under “text-to-game” the trello board and meetings are
            held here it is our main way of communicating.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>GitHub</h5>
    <ul id="Nathan">
        <li><a href="https://github.com/s3812496/text-to-game">https://github.com/s3812496/text-to-game</a></li>
        <li>o We are using GitHub in combination with GitHub desktop and Kraken to push changes on our code to
            collaborate on the program, everyone has been sent an invite to the repo and can make changes to it, to
            access it people will have to add the repo to their git software and pull changes before starting to write
            code as well as make detailed descriptions when ever a commit is pushed to GitHub to make clash resolution
            easier.</li>
    </ul>

        TTG’s assignment 1 project will require us to use the appropriate tools and technologies in order to accomplish
        our task. All team members will mainly use the compiling application “Eclipse,” to code each of their set
        functionalities into the program. Other variations of this such as “Microsoft Studio” will also be used as some
        of us have more experience using that program. These applications are ideal for us as we are all novices in
        programming, in that they allow us to easily identify errors in our code. We all have experience using one or
        more of these applications, meaning none of us have a learning curve we have to overcome, allowing us to work
        when we need to work. We will be implementing it with the technology of JavaScript. This programming language is
        very versatile, allowing us to create our story driven game that will let the user to write and play their own
        story. These applications are both free and run on both mac and windows operating systems, minimizing any
        potential problems we may face when sharing code. However, although we all have experience in writing code in
        java, we may run across problems as some are more adept than others, thus we will have to divide the work
        accordingly whilst still making it fair. Another alternative option that we will attempt is that we will try to
        teach some members of the group how to code more advanced applications through tutorials either from us or
        online.

        This task will require us to organize our code for ease of access. This is an important as many issues can arise
        when a group of programmers are working the same project. An example of this would be when two people try to
        alter a file, creating two new files instead of one. A service called “GitHub” will allow us to edit our code
        together simultaneously through “branches.” This segregates all parts of the project so multiple people can work
        on it without it compromising someone else’s’ section of the code. This service is also capable of saving all
        save versions of our project, allowing us to never lose a line of code. This is appropriate as it’s easy to use
        and it's also free, allowing everyone in the group to participate in it. The added bonus of using “GitHub” is
        that it’s popular amongst the internet. Meaning that if we run into problems then there are thousands of videos
        online made to educate users on how to use the software. Since we all have previous experience in using this
        software however, we may not need utilize this.

        <li>All members are expected to assign themselves tasks to complete during the week</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The process for dealing with unmet expectations or problems that may arise:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The leader assigned to the area will be informed by the person experiencing the difficulty’s</li>
        <li>The leader will attempt to resolve the issue by themselves</li>
        <li>If the problem still persists a group meeting will be held to resolve the issue</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Peer feedback will be dealt with in the following manner:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The group leader is to be informed of the feedback</li>
        <li>The group leader will bring this forward with the person in question</li>
        <li>If this person continues to not rectify the problem a group meeting will be held</li>
        <li>If the problem still persists the tutor will be contacted regarding it</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The Trello board is to be updated after items are completed and is the tool that will be used to track progress and contributions to the project, GitHub will also be used as we enter the programming stages of the project changes are only to be pushed if they have a valid description to them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Group members are to indicate their agreement regarding this contract on Spark PLUS.
