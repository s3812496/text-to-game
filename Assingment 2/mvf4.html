		<h1>MVF-4 Saving Progress</h1>
		<h2>Lucid Textual Explanation</h2>
		<p>A vital function that would be required for the ‘text-to-game’ program to run as intended would be the option to save progress. Saving progress is important as it allows the user to continue working or playing where they have left off without losing any progress. The user would be able to save their progress by pressing the ‘Save’ button which may normally be situated at the bottom of the screen or accessible by pressing the ‘Esc’ key on your keyboard. Saving progress works by the program ‘recording’ the current state of the game and storing it as a variable or saving existing piece of work that the author has contributed towards making their game. For example, for a user that is playing the game that the author has created, the ‘saving progress’ function would work by taking a snapshot of the current state of the game and recording the variables such as current level, current health, score etc. However, for the author creating their game, the ‘saving progress’ function would allow them to save their work, similarly to a student saving their work so that they are able to work on it at a later time. If the author is working on creating text options, or uploading images for their game, the save function would progressively allow the continuation of completing the game.

		<h2>Validation Testing</h2>
		<p>Validation testing is “the process of ensuring if the tested and developed software satisfies the client needs.” Validation testing is important in ensuring that the final product is satisfactory and is working as intended with no room for error or glitches. In terms of saving progress within text-to-game, validation testing must occur to enable saving to work as smoothly as possible. An example of validation testing occurring when the user is saving is making sure if the user would like to save. By doublechecking and ensuring that the user wants to save assists the user in removing the opportunity to creating unnecessary save files by accidentally pressing the button. If the user were to accidentally press the save button multiple times without realizing, the save files will become clustered and may be confusing to the user. By adding that extra step to the save process, this may help ease the possibility of multiple saves. Furthermore, when the user wants to overwrite one of their existing saves, they are prompted if they are sure they would like to overwrite the existing save to ensure that they do not accidentally overwrite an old save and lose their progress. Validation testing may also occur during the testing stage of the project to ensure that the button works and is saving the current state of the game as intended. When users press the ‘Save’ button, testing must occur to ensure that the button is working and directs the user to the save page where they can choose a save-slot in which they would like to save to.  
		</p>
		<h2>Validation Criteria</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Is the save button doing something when clicked on?</li>
			<li>Is the save button working as intended?</li>
			<li>Are users provided a prompt asking whether they are sure they want to save after clicking on the save button?</li>
			<li>Are there sufficient save slots for the user to save into?</li>
			<li>Can this work on mobile?</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Firstly, for the user to be able to save, there must be information to save otherwise the save function would be pointless. After inputting some information that the user would like to save, they can press the ‘Save’ button. After that, a dialogue box would open prompting the user if they are sure that if they intended to save. This step allows the user to double check whether they would like to save incase they accidentally pressed the save button by accident. If the user would like to save, they are directed to the next option to choose which save file they would like to save their data into followed up yet another confirmation dialogue incase they overwrite an existing save file. Some example data that users can save are images, scenery, background, dialogue and many more. This also works for the user that is playing the game, as they would not want to start the game from the beginning after making progress. This button is vital in ensuring that users do not lose their progress whilst using our program and can return at any time as if they never left.

		<h2>User Stories</h2>
		<table style="width:100%">
			<tr>
				<td>Registered User</td>
				<td>As a ‘registered user’, I want to be able to save my progress whilst playing the text-to-game. Being able to save my progress whilst playing the game allows me to progress through the game without having the need to start all over again.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Registered Author</td>
				<td>As a ‘registered author’, I want to be able to save progress whilst creating my own text-to-game. Being able to save my progress while I am creating my game allows me to create my ideal game one step at a time and is a vital function that the program must have.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Admin</td>
				<td>As an ‘admin’, the functionality to be able to save progress is an important feature. By allowing users to save their progress, an admin can manage the save data of users and authors. </td>
			</tr>
