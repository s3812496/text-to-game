		<h1>MVF-2 Creating new options feature</h1>
		<p>“Text-To-Game” will require its authors to create one or more pathways to their chapters in their story. This is one of the core features of the game as it allows the players to choose their own path. Depending on how many outcomes have been created by the author, the players will be shown a series of numbers that represent each pathway, ranging from 1 to the number of pathways created by the author. The number selected by the player determines the direction of the story. If an author would like to add a pathway, they would need to first have already started creating their story with our program. Once they have inputted their first chapter,  they then will be able to click “Create new chapter.” The author can then assign a designated number to this new chapter. In order to make the options as clear and understandable to the players as possible, the author will be granted the ability to assign text to each number that will describe the pathway. Each pathway will be visually shown inside of a box at the bottom of each screen, leaving the rest of the text and visuals above. For example, a user has created a story that challenges its players to decide to either eat a mango, apple, or orange. This requires three options for the user to choose from, thus located at the bottom of the screen there will be three boxes titled “1. Eat mango,” “2. Eat apple” or “3. Eat orange.” A player may input “3” and is greeted to the next screen “you have found a worm in your apple… you are now sick.” This is intended to be used to create stories that attempt to either entertain or educate. 
		</p>
		<p>Validating user inputs ensures that the program will be able to run without any errors. This is done with our game as we can’t have players either greeted by empty chapters, or chapters without any options to select from. In order for a new chapter to be created, the game requires that the author has already launched into the program and only once they have created at least 2 pathways, can they then create a new chapter. Another validation test that will be performed by the system is that if an author leaves either a text box empty or the story of that chapter empty, they will not be able to pursue in creating the next chapter. If an author were to do such a thing, they would be greeted with a message saying “Please fill in the empty text fields,” this message refers to all text fields as the players need as much context as possible in order for it to be effective.

		<h2>User Story</h2>
		<p>As an aspiring author, I would like to add pathways to my story for my reader’s to be able to choose from. This is so that I can have multiple stories, detailing all of my desired plot lines in the one place to enhance their engagement, share multiple stories and to extend reading time.
