		<h1>Collaborative Workspaces & Software</h1>
		<p>Due to COVID-19, students are required to partake in remote learning. For this project, our group used exclusively Microsoft Teams and Trello to work together in an agile workspace. We had short group meetings with one another to quickly review the work that was needed to be done. We also utilised Microsoft Teams to hold team meetings with specific team members to discuss certain tasks that potentially overlapped each other. Meetings were also used to ask for assistance from more skilled and experienced individuals - often to ask for guidance regarding coding in Java.  Trello was used as an agile approach for completing weekly tasks. The virtual Kanban board allowed us to see at any given moment what needed to be done and the progress of the task. It helped with visualizing work and boosted collaboration between team members.

		<p>Each TTG member has used many different technologies to complete this assignment. Thus far into the project we’ve taken advantage of ‘Trello,’ ‘Microsoft Teams,’ ‘Word,’ ‘AWS, ’‘GitHub,’ and ‘Eclipse’. Each having their own specific uses to help aid us in our organisation, communication, and work.  
		</p>
		<p>Using the online service ‘Trello,’ we have been able to moderate each team member to visually see who has completed their tasks, what tasks they are currently working on, and tasks they are planned to do. This has been important to the group as it assures no mistakes can be made and no work gets left out.  
		</p>
		<p>‘Microsoft Teams’ has allowed us to communicate with each other via text and video for group meetings. This service can record these chats that everyone is able to refer back too if needed. Throughout the semester we’ve been holding weekly meetings and sending group messages to make sure everyone gets the help they need with their work and to keep everyone up to date. These meetings help keep continuity throughout the project as it is a group assignment.  
		</p>
		<p>Microsoft’s ‘Office’ is the software mostly used for writing, editing, and saving all of our written work. This has been provided to us by our university which creates a safeguard in that we know we all have the same version and thus our formatting will remain as intended. This has been an issue in previous years with varying versions of this software behaving differently to one another. 
		</p>
		<p>Amazon’s ‘AWS’ host’s the team’s website which contains all of our completed work. This is also used to display who each member is and to timetable what work needs to be done throughout the weeks of development. 
		</p>
		<p>‘GitHub’ is a service that allows us to share our code with one another. Due to the level of complexity of our project, we’ve started using this to ensure we can have everything programmed to meet all of our requirements before our deadline.  
		</p>
		<p>A coding compiler titled ‘Eclipse’ has been useful for our team members that have begun programming. This software will be used by everyone to code each of our features into our overall program. This includes our main and extended features that are each designed to give our users extra flexibility to be able to create their stories.
