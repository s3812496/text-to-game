		<h2>User Stories</h2>
		<table style="width:100%">
			<tr>
				<td>Registered User</td>
				<td>As a ‘registered user’, I want the final product to be able to run from the device that I am playing the game on. Is the final product able to be read and opened by my computer with existing programs or would I have to download the game in an executable file? The final story must be compiled into a readable and executable file so that I am able to access the game.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Registered Author</td>
				<td>As a ‘registered author’, I want to be able to compile all the scenarios and stories into a readable file that is easy to follow along and makes sense. The story must make sense to the reader and be accessible.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Admin</td>
				<td>As an ‘admin’, the story must be able to be compiled into a single file and be executable so that users are able to open the file. If the file were not able to be compiled and read by the computer, the program would essentially be useless.</td>

		<h2>Lucid textual explanation</h2>
		<p>The feature to essentially put together all the different scenarios and situations that the author has created into one final product and ship that to the consumer is a minimum viable feature. Essentially, this feature ensures that all the elements of the story can be met and that there are no dead ends within the story and that this story can be read by the user. To elaborate, the final story that the author wishes to publish is all of their previous chapters and stories into one big text-game and this feature essentially puts all these chapters together into one story which is able to be read by the user. Furthermore, this ‘compilation’ of chapters, that is the story, must be able to be accessible by the user. Should the author wish to publish their game, a separate executable file would be created which is the game and must be able to be accessed and opened by the user. This executable file should be compatible with the device that the user wishes to run the platform on and as a result is an important feature of the text-to-game program.  
		</p>
		<h2>Validation testing</h2>
		<p>Validation testing occurs to check whether there is a readable story to compile. For starters, there must be a check to make sure that there is a story for the program to compile into one. If there was no story to compile, then the final product would not work as intended. As a result, the program must conduct a few checks to ensure that the final product is working. An example of these validation tests is the program checking whether there is data or not that is entered. This can be done by seeing if there is any input where there is supposed to be input. If not, the program may prompt the user to double-check their program.
		</p>
		<h2>Validation criteria</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Is there data to compile?</li>
			<li>Is the program executable?</li>
			<li>Does the program work on other platforms?</li>
			<li>Is it supported by the operating system?</li>
			<li>Are users able to understand the story?</li>
			<li>Are the compiled stories in sequential order?</li>
			<li>Is there a separate executable program to run the game?</li>
		</ul>

		<p>This is an example of the program being able to compile all the chapters into one final story and allowing the author to publish their final story as the game. After publishing, a separate file is available for users to access and play the game that the author has created. This file is an executable file which is the game that allows users to access the game.
