	<h1>Project Background</h1>
	
	<h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>This project all started at the beginning of the semester when our group first came together, and a team was born. As a team, we all collectively grew up playing and loving video games which was a common interest amongst us. Growing up in an environment surrounded by video games bred the passion for each of our members and as such this was the perfect opportunity to create something that would allow others to also share this passion our group has. As a result, we decided that trying to recreate a text-based game would be a fun and innovative way to show other people what video games are all about. With text-to-game, we are providing a platform for both authors and users to share their innovative and imaginative ideas that would allow them to create their own text-based game. Authors can use our program to create playable chapters and stories in which they can then publish which would allow other users looking to play text-based games to give it a shot. This would provide authors who want to create a game but do not necessarily have the programming skills an opportunity to create their own text-game which was what our group was trying to accomplish.</p>

In terms of IT skills, my biggest strength would have to be design however I enjoy programming. Although I enjoy programming, I am quite a beginner in it and there is plenty of room for improvement in which this project would provide me with some basic programming experience. Through completing this project, I have acquired some time management skills and have learnt to manage my time more effectively and efficiently through the use of the Trello board and the weekly mentor sessions which helped me work on the project bit by bit every week.</td>
			<td>My assigned role within the group was to design the interface and design the mock-ups/wireframes.  Furthermore, another task that was assigned to me was working on most of the documentation for the project. </td>

		  <td>I found this project very challenging but also extremely interesting. I love the idea of text based games even if my writing skills are poor. I loved the challenge of figuring out how it can be done. There were many many bumps and the inclusion of a website through us for a loop. Had I known about the bumps beforehand I would not have chosen java. The main challenge in this project was getting everybody to pull their weight. I learnt a lot about web servers and code integration. I know my coding skills have vastly improved over the course of this project.</td>

		  <td>My interest in IT involves programming and exploring ideas that involve understanding how users behave. Learning, developing and compiling code in any language further sparks my interest within the topic as the more involved I become, the more I learn about my unknown skills and the topic as a whole. This interest stems from my early engagement with technology as at a young age I was involved with building computers and gaming. The skills I had previously obtained through schooling, included light programming in python, java, html, and CSS. However, prior to this project my understanding of html and CSS were minimal. However, after observing how one of our team members created our website with html, I learnt a lot of tricks that will help me with coding websites in the future. This mainly consists of grouping sections of code together with CSS, that allows only certain sections to be affected when dealing with the design of a website. I also improved my communication skills as I noticed from earlier stages of the groupâ€™s project, it needed someone who could help lead in giving out tasks and setting up meetings.</td>
			<td>In this section of the assignment I contributed towards mainly written work as programming these features across multiple devices, with different people, with different skill sets within programming would lead to many errors.</td>

I found this project interesting as it forced me to develop more skills in java</td>

My skills before undergoing this project mainly lied within what I learnt during my time in Introduction to Programming. I had some experience with basic java but struggled to apply my knowledge to this project throughout its lifespan to the point where I would say that I have not learnt a whole lot in terms of coding.  If I were to do something different, it would be to not be afraid to ask for help and invest more time into improving my foundations in coding</td>

	<h2>Aims and Goals</h2>
	<h3>Aim</h3>
	
  <p>The aim of text-to-game is to create an interactive playable program which would allow authors to create their own games along with their own chapters and storylines and for it to be playable by other users. We hope to create a simple yet effective program which would provide the bare backbone for authors to get started with their game. As a result, in achieving this aim, there are a few goals that must be accomplished for the aim to become a reality. These goals are as following:</p>
	
  <h3>Goals</h3>
	
  <table style="width:100%">
		
		<tr>
			<td width="12%">Ability to create chapters</td>
			<td width="88%">An important goal that we must accomplish is giving the authors the ability to create their own chapters. Since the aim of our group is to create a project that allows authors to create their own games, it is vital that authors are given the ability to create their own individual storylines and chapters.</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td>Storage database</td>'
			<td>To store the information and chapters, the program must have a database in which the information can be gathered from. The database would be used to store all the necessary information that the author may choose to add into their text-to-game. The database would hold data such as chapters, characters, maps and many more.</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
		  <td>The option to import images</td>
		  <td>The option to import images would also be a goal that our program ideally would have. Importing images would allow the users to visualize the activities or environment that they are in whilst they are playing the game. Therefore, this goal would help bring our program to the next level as images are a vital aspect in games as they help immerse the user into the game and make it feel like they are a character within the game.</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
		  <td>Compatible with user device</td>
		  <td>To accomplish our aim of having a playable program, the program must be compatible with the device of the author or the user. Therefore, this goal is about ensuring that our program is compatible or can be run with most popular devices or operating systems out there. To achieve this goal, our program will be created using java which is a very common application that is compatible with almost all devices</td>
		</tr>

	<h2>Scope</h2>
  <h3>Project Progress</h3>
  
	<p>The idea of Text-to-Game began from the initial group meeting on Microsoft Teams between a few members. Once the idea was followed up to other members and agreed to, we began to work towards receiving confirmation and validity of our idea. We pitched the product, providing descriptions while reviewing the purpose and aim of our project. Throughout the project, the original plan of creating a program that allowed others to create a text game remained intact. It was only until much later into the project that we would decide to create a story using the Text-to-Game application as an additional part of our presentation. We also want to present the application as it is with a functioning user interface.</p>
	<p>Generally, our group did not experience much of a scope creep since we mainly kept towards completing the Minimal Viable Features (MVFs). However, if we had our time again, we would most likely try to identify different MVFs that are more significant to the project as we did receive verbal feedback that our MVFs seemed a bit more like EVFs.</p>
	<p>We had some issues while using Trello which mainly had to do with lack of consistent use from most members. Sometimes the task would not be enough to achieve full marks during the weekly stand-ups so members would have to allocate themselves extra tasks to fulfill the criteria. The first few weeks were fine with all members following the Trello plan, but it eventually saw a slow decline in usage. The plan increasingly became more confusing to follow and resulted in most members exclusively using Trello to occasionally upload work that was set through discussion in team meetings. Perhaps the Trello plan could have been more carefully fleshed out from the very beginning as it seemed to be a bit rushed.</p>
