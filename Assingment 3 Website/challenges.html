  <h1>Challenges and Learning</h1>
		
  <h3>Describe what the challenges have been, how you addressed them, and what you have learned from them.</h3>
  <p>The challenges our group faced was the challenge of one of the agile principles. We do not believe that this problem was only our group’s problem, but in fact every group faced the problem of not being able to convey information face to face. “The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to within a development team is face-to-face conversation”. This agile principle made it very difficult for our group due to not being able to communicate our thoughts and opinions face to face. This issue was overcome by using video-calling online which was a solution however could not replace the interaction that face-to-face meetings provide. We learnt that face-to-face interaction always trumps online interaction.</p>
		
  <h3>What have you found easy? What have you found difficult? What was unexpected? In what ways have you been stretched? Note that these challenges will likely vary for each person in the group. Only say the group found something challenging if all of you had an issue. Use tables to summarize.</h3>

		      <td><p>-Our group found that the documentation was generally the easiest part. This was due to the fact that we were able to easily allocate tasks that needed to be written up</p></td>
		      <td><p>-What the group found difficult was the inability to communicate face-to-face which made it difficult with some aspects of the project such as brainstorming effectively to bounce ideas off of eachother.</p>
		        <p>-Another difficulty was the busy and conflicting schedules of the majority of the members of the group which made it difficult to organise meetings in which everyone was able to attend.&nbsp;</p></td>

	<h3>What challenges were you expecting? What have you done to address these? Have they been overcome?</h3>
	
	<p>The challenge of time management was a problem that our group was expecting when first given this project. The first few weeks were no problem as everyone was sticking to the timetable laid out by Trello however as time went on, Trello usage dipped. Our group found it difficult to adjust and spend adequate amounts of time each week to work on the project and frequently left it to the last minute. For assignment 3, our group worked to rectify this issue by allocating more time to this assignment and tried to reach the weekly quotas that we each assigned ourselves to spend at least 5 hours each week working on the project.</p>
	
	<h3>What are the new skills or experience you have learned and/or developed? Include those that have not worked out. For example, using a particular tool but finding it will not work in the way you anticipated.</h3>
	<p>New skills and experiences that our group has learned was the use of Trello. Before this project, no one from our group had heard of or seen Trello. However, with this project Trello proved to be a useful tool in the beginning stages of this project. It worked well to let group members see what was being worked on and what had to be done by the said weeks.</p>
	
	<h3>Plans change, did yours? (plans can change in more ways than simply the timetable. For example, your aims and/or goals change, or roles change, or unanticipated events.) In hindsight, would you make any changes to your plan now? Have things turned out as you expected? What would you do differently if you had your time over again?</h3>
	<p>Our plans generally did not change and we were quite consistent in following our table. However in saying this, extra slack had to be picked up due to one of our group members not contributing much to the assignment. This led to other group members having to pick up extra work to make up for this which led to an unforeseen increase in workload for some of the group members. In hindsight, if our group was to make any changes to the timetable it would be to</p>
	
	<h3>Was your timetable realistic? What would you change in your timetable, knowing what you do now? Justify your answer.</h3>
	<p>Our timetable was realistic as it had set out a realistic amount of work that could have been done in that given time frame. If we were to change our timetable, our group would include big milestones similarly to a Gantt chart which would outline the most important aspects of the timetable. In this project, submission dates could be marked with a star to let group members know that this was important, and that it was coming up and lots of work needed to be done prior to this date.</p>
	
	<h3>Have the tools and technologies worked out as expected? Have any of the risks you identified materialized? Have there been unanticipated events affecting your progress?</h3>
	<p>The tools and technologies did work out as expected. The primary tool we used during this assignment was Eclipse which was used to code the project and also Microsoft Teams which was our means of communication. These technologies worked well and helped us to get the job done. The risks we identified were timely constraints in which we thought that we would not get the project done in time. This was partly true due to the fact that our assignment was not up to par or to the standard that it should have been at due to not having enough time. An unanticipated event that affected our progress was some of our group members not doing their allocated tasks which affected our overall progress.</p>
	
	<h3>Scope</h3>
	<p>Text-To-Game’s development process has consisted of constructing all of our previous set goals. Within our project’s timeline, our group has produced a working prototype that consists of all our required features. This is essential as our five main features all contribute to helping the core functionality of our program in creating stories. Our prototype consists of allowing users to create chapters, create new options for users to select while reading, view all created chapters, save their progress, and lastly it is able to compile stories into a readable form for other users. Our program allows users to share educational and entertaining stories through the form of gaming, extending our reach to more users as they are shared around. Our program is constrained to the limitations of our group’s skill sets and thus the prototype is not ready to be used by the public. This is due to a need of a testing phase in which consists of removing bugs and creating fixes. Text-To-Game enables its users to replicate their stories into a playable game, making the outcome of our project a game that serves as a tool to teach lessons or entertain.</p>
