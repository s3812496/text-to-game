		<h3>What have you learned about group projects? What has worked well in your group? What hasn’t worked well?</h3>
		
		<p>The ability to work effectively and efficiently within a team is a trait that is important in the IT industry. This group project allowed our group to have a taste of what it is like to work in a team environment and gave us an understanding of what it is going to be like in the real world. What worked well within our group was that we had a wide range of skills that each of the group members possessed which allowed us to learn off one another. Whilst some groups members excel at programming, they may not be great at design or write ups. In Anthony’s case, when it comes to programming, he's still learning and therefore his knowledge of programming wasn’t as great compared to the other group members who were proficient with programming such as Nathan, Carlin and Nicholas. To make up for this, he did most of the write-ups, administrative tasks and designing a lot of the mockups. Nicholas then worked on the majority of the backend programming whilst teaching the rest of us. As a result, the members who weren’t proficient in programming were able to learn off the others who were particularly good at programming which wouldn’t have been possible if our group didn’t have a diverse skill group in which we could all learn things off of each other.  However, there were plenty of things that the group did not do well. We have learnt that within a group, organization and time management is very important to ensure that group tasks and goals are accomplished on time. This proved to be quite difficult for our group as things were often left until the last minute and the work was often rushed resulting in a lower quality of work. Something that could have been improved on was having more group meetings to check up on all the group members to see where everyone is up to and to bounce ideas back and forth between each other. If this were to happen, we believe that our group would have had more success. Having good communication is something that group projects depend on however in our case, group communication was quite limited which often caused confusion within the group.</p>
		
		<h3>What use did you make of your Mentor? What use did you make of your Lecturer in guiding you? What were the group processes for communication? How effective were they? Have there been any changes since the start of the semester?</h3>
		<p>The group had very mixed use of the mentor as some of us did not attend the weekly mentoring sessions whereas others did.  As a result, our group had made mixed use of the mentor. Anthony made good use of the mentor (Ivan) by emailing Ivan and asking what could have been improved with his use-case diagram. Ivan was very helpful in guiding him on the right track. Ivan also gave our group plenty of feedback in terms of what we should do or improve upon in which the group noted and tried to act upon the feedback. In terms of the lecturer (Isaac Balbin), our group mainly used his announcements within the Microsoft Teams channel as a means of guidance and regularly checked to see whether announcements were made that were relevant to the group. His discussion proved to be a great help in leading our group in the right direction when we had to get our project approved. For group communication, our group primarily used our allocated channel in Microsoft Teams. This proved to be the main point of communication in which meetings were held occasionally and group members were able to message each other.  This was quite effective as Microsoft Teams did its job as providing a means of communication within our group allowing us to message each other where needed. However, in hindsight, our group should have been more active within the Microsoft Teams channel and attend more mentoring sessions to get to know where each of the other group members are up to.  Since most of the group members did not attend these sessions, the group was often left confused and in the dark about the progress of our assignment. This proved to be quite hard down the line nearing the submission dates and having more effective communication means would have benefitted the group greatly.</p>
		
		<h3>From your experience in this project, what is the important aspect of organizing a project of this nature? Is there anything that you would do differently if you were to start again?</h3>
		<p>From our group experience within this group project, the most important aspect of organizing a project of this nature would definitely have to be communication and organization. Communication plays a very vital role in group projects especially in such a big project as this, it is important that the group is in daily contact to monitor the progress of the project. As a result, we believe that this was the most important aspect of organizing a project and would be the thing that our group would do differently if we were to start again. For starters,  we would start by organizing every group member weekly schedule and trying to find a time that would work for everyone. In this project, it was very rare for every group member to be on at the same time and therefore we were left in the dark with many aspects of the group. This could have perhaps been solved if everyone were more transparent with their schedules and were more committed to having daily meetings.</p>
		
		<h3>What advice would you give to a group about to embark on a similar project?</h3>
		<p>Our group advice to give to another group about to embark on a similar project would be to clearly set out the goals and milestones of the project that everyone should be aiming to complete. I would also advise other groups to be open with individual progress to ensure that everyone is on the same page and completes what needs to be done by the given milestones.</p>
