            I am in my second semester of this course. My passions in IT aren’t as clear as I want them to be yet. In
            terms of my technical abilities I still consider myself a beginner. I find coding to be quite intimidating
            and a bit stressful but still rather interesting. To find my interests I still need to expand and delve
            further into my learning to make a concrete decision. I find that my lack of technical skills tends to hold
            me back in properly contributing to the team so at the very least, I’d like to make progress towards
            improving my abilities. I predict that when it comes to coding in this project, I might find myself
            struggling but I will still be able to contribute a lot to written work.

            I completed intro to IT in semester 1 and both of my parents work in the IT industry. I very much prefer the
            technical side of IT and programming. I am quick to learn and I am always playing around with different
            programming tricks and techniques. I love AI and creating any program big or small that I know will help
            someone. I do tend to be forgetful and I am unfortunately the type of student who likes to push projects off
            until the last minute, but this is something I am pushing to fix. I am unfortunately not very good at
            writing my written contributions tend to be either too lengthy or too short and negatively impact the
            overall project. I expect to be in a technical lead, and I hope to help the people who are still starting
            with programming to get their bearings and explain the parts of the program that they may struggle with.

            I have always loved IT and have been playing around with computers since I was about 5 years old. I love
            taking them apart and putting them back together, hoping it will work again. I love playing games and that’s
            where my interests started. I am pretty new at programming and will need to put in a lot of work to be able
            to actually help my group and not hinder, however I am reasonably good at writing and will be able to cover
            the report side of the project comfortably. I will struggle with the coding side of things but hope to team
            up with one of the technical leads of the group and learn how to do it, while helping them as much as I can
            with the report writing if they need the assistance.

            I am currently in my second semester here at RMIT, my grandfather worked in the industry and I am currently
            working at a small it shop doing repairs and small server work, I enjoy programming quite a lot I know HTML
            CSS, VB, Java, python, and some other .NET framework languages I believe that I will be more useful for the
            team with my GitHub and programming knowledge rather than my writing skills I see myself as being stronger
            at programming. I expect to be the lead in terms of GitHub, and I am willing to teach others how to use it
            properly as well as helping others with any programming problems that they come in to.

            My name is Anthony and I’m studying in my second semester at RMIT. I have grown up surrounded by technology
            and computers and have always been fascinated by them and have spent a considerable amount of time on them
            throughout my life. My passion in IT was strongly reinforced by my dad who also worked within the IT field
            as an IT consultant and thus inspired me to also want to study within the IT field. My strong points in IT
            lie within troubleshooting and helping other people fix their technical issues. My main weakness would have
            to be programming however I am a beginner and am learning new things every day and am trying to improve my
            programming skills. Furthermore, I would like to hone my design skills as well as my programming skills and
            hope that this assignment will help me in achieving that. The challenges I see myself face within this
            assignment would have to be the coding aspects as I am not confident at all and hope that one of my other
            group members would be able to guide me in the right direction.

            My name is Carlin McNamara and I'm currently in my first year of university studying one of my favourite
            hobbies that will eventually turn into a job. I’ve been invested in the world of technology for its
            seemingly alien-like characteristics which both scare and excite me. This all stems from one of my family
            members buying a computer back in 2008. This sparked my journey to learning programming, playing games, and
            socialising with friends online. I found myself naturally becoming more and more involved in the tech world
            and decided to start studying it. However, just like with any other skill, sometimes I can get put off
            whenever I can’t figure out how to do something in terms coding. Overcoming those moments make me want to
            continue do better so I can contribute more and help classmates in my group projects. My strongest skill is
            the ability to maintain my interest in computers. I am confident that this team is more than capable of
            accomplishing our assignment together as we all seemingly have the same level of dedication and passion
            towards our idea. We all have our own set of skills that we can learn from and adapt to, making us a good
            combination of students to be working together.
