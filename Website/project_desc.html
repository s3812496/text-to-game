        <p>
            Text-to-Game is a computer program aimed towards people who want to create a text-based game but lack the
            necessary skills do to so. It hopes to benefit the niche community of text-based games by spawning the
            opportunity for the average person to innovate and share their ideas.

            As a user, I need to be able to organize and structure my game using chapters to create a comprehensive
            story.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a user, I need to be able to show different events and outcomes as a result of interactive text through
            child chapters
        </p>
        <p>
            As a user, I need to be able to easily view and visually comprehend how chapters and objects are connected
            to each other through a tree map with multiple branches. I need to also have the function to be able to
            edit, move, delete etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a user, I need to be able to save my work and come back to it without losing any progress.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a user, I need to be able to have my written story compiled into a readable text-based game.

            Our group named “Text-To-Game,” is beginning to develop our idea of a user-oriented story game. With a size
            of six capable programmers, we will be designing and programming a game with the same name that helps build
            user’s creativity. The user will create their own story with multiple outcomes that other users can journey
            down onto. This application will encourage our users to think of stories that may tell important life
            lessons, or anything else that their imagination can come up with. This also encourages users to be social
            in that they can swap stories with their friends. Our target demographic is anyone at the age of 13 onwards.
            This is mostly intended for gamers, however anyone with a narrative can play. This idea was inspired by
            other story driven games such as Tell-tale’s “The walking dead” series. This game works in a very similar
            fashion in that the outcome of the narrative depends on the user’s choices. However, we believe that there
            is value in allowing users to create their own stories as it gives them an outlet to share experiences. This
            also eases the workload on us as we don’t have to think of a compelling story that users may or may not
            like. Over the upcoming weeks we will begin development and will seek out help from one another when needed.
        </p>

            With the many experiences we go through on a day-to-day basis, sometimes people want to re-tell those
            experiences in the hopes to educate or entertain their peers. However, if they lack certain communication
            skills, sometimes they’re unable to get those messages across in the way they wanted. This game allows
            people who lack those skills to do so in a different format that they would more likely be comfortable with.
            This gives them time to think about how they would want to approach achieving this and the game will also be
            able to save where they last left off. An example of this is perhaps an ethics teacher found a $20 note on
            the ground and had to make the ethical decision on whether to pocket it for himself, or hand it into lost
            and found. He may want to create a story reflecting his experience to show his class to see whether if it
            was okay to pocket it or not. This game would allow him to communicate a certain message as he could choose
            the outcome for keeping the money, resulting in them getting caught, leading to detention. On the contrary,
            if they handed it in, the principle would let them keep it for their honesty. If the teacher were to think
            of something new to add to the story, he can do so by adding “child chapters” in between his previous
            chapters. The potential of a game that allows its users to set the path is only limited to their
            imagination. This teacher may not have lacked communication skills but was still able to utilise the game to
            help him educate his students. This would be done firstly on the teacher’s laptop/desktop, where he would
            create his story. He would then share it to his class via his preferred method of sharing, then lastly the
            students would load up the scenario on their screen. They would then have the freedom to go down each
            chapter through their desired paths, and they can replay it to seek the alternative outcomes of the story.
        </p>

            “Text-To-Game” has many skills that will help the end user to create their stories. Our goal is to simplify
            the process as much as possible in order to get out of the author’s way and let them create. This idea was
            inspired to us by annoying applications and operating systems that tend to get in the way of the user,
            instead of efficiently allowing them to do what they want. For example, our user’s will have the opportunity
            to see what they’ve created in a map that visually shows them each chapter done thus far. This map gives
            them the freedom to edit or delete parts of their story in an easy way if they choose to do so. This would
            be particularly useful as most writers are known to often have critiques of their own work, this would allow
            them to mitigate that. However, once our users are done, they can save their story for either themselves or
            to share with whoever they please. Another skill “TTG” has is the ability to add music and pictures to go
            alongside each chapter of the narrative. This gives the story more character as it visually and audibly
            gives us more context to each scenario and has the potential to improve the overall story. This is
            particularly an important feature as many people can lose interest if they’re not naturally intrigued by the
            narrative itself.
