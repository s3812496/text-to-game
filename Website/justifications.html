        <h1>Project Justifications</h1>
        <h5>Workload</h5>
        <p>
            We are doing our best to split the workload of this project between each team member equally. We will have
            one person leading a section for each week of work, and the team leader will change each week. The team
            leader will be primarily responsible for whatever section that they are assigned to, however they will not
            be expected to do it all alone and will have other members of the group available for assistance. We have
            set up a timetable with what goals we want to achieve and in what time frames and listed with each goal is a
            team leader.
            While we expect to try and keep the workload as even and balanced as possible between each person in the
            group, it is highly likely that it won’t work out to be so. With different people helping different team
            leaders, some people will quite possibly end up taking on more work than others. This will be noted and
            taken into account each time that it happens though, and if after a week one person has done a lot more work
            than someone else, then the following week they won’t be expected to do as much so as to bring it back into
            balance. Once again that is all expected, and the actual workloads may work out to continue to differ
            throughout the project.
        </p>

        <h5>Beyond Current Capabilities</h5>
        <p>
            This project has been chosen by our group because we all agreed that it seemed interesting and we would
            enjoy it. However, upon further research and exploration of the idea we realized it could be a very
            challenging project and decided that it would be a great opportunity for us to expand our knowledge. As it
            stands most of us only have experience from semester 1 intro to programming when it comes to creating our
            own programs and using java to code. One member in the group has a broader knowledge of java and will be
            taking place as primary technical lead, while another few members have experience in other languages and
            will be trying to cross over their knowledge of languages like python and SQL and putting it to use and just
            getting acquitted with java. Another couple of members have very little knowledge of java and struggled with
            intro to programming and every single part of this project will be expanding their knowledge. When it comes
            to the minimal viable features that we have chosen, all of them are currently out of our reach and
            accomplishing each and every one of them shall be expanding upon our knowledge and shall be pushing us out
            of our comfort zones. This text-to-game creator shall be a challenge and a fantastic project to allow us to
            expand our knowledge and push ourselves to learn eloquent solutions to difficult problems since we believe
            it will be near impossible to solve them with brute force coding.
        </p>
        <p>
            No one within the group is expecting this project to be easy or simple. We all understand that this is going
            to require hard work and a lot of effort put in for us to succeed and for us to be truly happy with the
            results of our work. There will be a substantial amount of learning to be undertaken by every member of the
            group, and everyone is aware of this fact.
        </p>


        <h5>Risks</h5>
        <p>
            One risk that we have discussed is time. As a group we have acknowledged that choosing to do such a
            potentially large project it is quite unlikely that we will have a complete and fully functioning program by
            the end of the semester. Trying to make a text-to-game creator will involve a lot of research into areas we
            might not be comfortable in doing yet which will increase the time it will take to complete tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            To mitigate this issue, we have decided that rather than trying to have a complete and fully functioning
            program, we will pick out the minimum viable features and aim to have those finished and polished off, and
            then if time permits we will attempt to add and build towards the finished product.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another risk that we may come across is within communication. Our project is going to require very strong
            and clear communication. Due to us having a wide variation of skills and preferred focuses, we will need to
            maintain clear and concise communication so that everyone will be able to play their parts and fulfill their
            goals. If somebody fails to alert other members to problems or issues that they need assistance with or need
            another group member to complete something before they progress, then the project could very quickly fall
            apart.
        </p>
        <p>
            To avoid such instances occurring we are ensuring that we are having frequent group meetings as well as
            close monitoring of the MS Teams chat. We are trying to make sure that everyone has access to any work that
            the group has done in case they need to check something for their own parts of the assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The last risk that we shall be closely monitoring is the fact that we have chosen quite an ambitious project
            that will require us to learn and extend our current knowledge and do so in a timely manner, otherwise we
            will be unable to come anywhere near completing any of our MVF’s and thus fail to successfully complete our
            project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keeping this in mind, each member of our group will be doing their best to practice and research new
            techniques when it comes to coding with java and putting together little bits of code that will help us when
            we begin working on the different sections. We will also be relying upon teamwork with each other so that we
            have the more experience coders helping out the rookies where it is required, without smothering them and
            damaging the less practiced coder’s opportunities to learn new things.
